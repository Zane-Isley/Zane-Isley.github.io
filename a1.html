          <h2>Circuit Schematic:</h2>

            The circuit schematic for A1 was created using "www.circuit-diagram.org"
            and features my circuit in the state where is powered by a 9 volt battery.
            All connections to the Arduino Uno are in the correct ports, the LEDs have
            their anodes oriented correctly, and all lights are connected back to the
            ground port via the bread board.

            My circuit for A1 features three LED lights connected to my Arduino Uno
            via ports D13, D8, and D7. I needed to calculate the resistance for each
            of these LEDs. We know that yellow, red, and green LEDs all experience 1.8 V
            drop. After some research, I found that the Arduino Uno opporates at 5 V.
            V = I x R. We know I = 0.02. We know V = 5 - 1.8 (3.2). 3.2 = 0.02 x R,
            R = 3.2 / 0.02, R = 160 Ohms. I dont have a 160 Ohm resistors, so my circuit
            features 100 Ohm resistes.

          <h2>"Blinking" Operation:</h2>
          <div class="header">

          </div>
          <p>
            For my project, I decided to use the green, yellow, and red lights to
            envoke the feelings associated with a traffic light. I thought it was a
            fun (albeit predicatable) color scheme to base my blinks on. For the
            pattern itself, I actually had my roommate describe to me a blinking pattern
            that he would like to see, and I based the blinking on that. This is because,
            as designers, our creativity is often dictated by project managers, so
            I simmulated this in A1.

          <h2>Questions:</h2>
          <h4>
            Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the Y axis is voltage across the LEDs.
            Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.
          </h4>
          <img src="A1-vgraph.JPG" id="vgraph"/>
          <h4>
            How many LEDs could you blink at once with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
          </h4>
          <p>
            According to the Arduino Uno data sheets, the current limitation of the Arduino Uno is
            200mA. As each LEDs current draw is 20mA, we can assume that we could blink up to 10 LEDs
            at the same time before topping out the current limitation (20mA x 10 = 200mA).
          </p>
          <h4>
            How many LEDs could you blink with your Arduino if only one were to be on at once?
          </h4>
          <p>
            There are 14 digital pins (0-13) and 6 analog pins (a0-a6) on the Arduino Uno. Because each
            LED will be lit individually, we don't have to worry about the current draw of each one.
            14 + 6 results in 20 total LEDs that could be individually "blinked".
          </p>
          <h4>
            How fast do you need to blink your LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
          </h4>
          <p>
            I went about this problem in probably the least scientific way possible, but I am not able
            to attend class monday so I am not sure of a better way to do this. I used the Arduino IDE
            and set up a program that flashed the light for a tenth of a second. This was an obviously
            flashing light. I adjusted it to 0.05 seconds. Still flashing. The same was true at 0.025.
            Finally, me and the group of friends I was with descided that flashing for 0.009 secnds was
            the slowest blink we were unable to see. 60 / 0.009 = 6666.67, so that is roughly how many
            times you have to blink a light in a minute before you can no longer tell.
