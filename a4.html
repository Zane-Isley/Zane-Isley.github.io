            The circuit schematic for A4 was created using "www.circuit-diagram.org"
            I used a red and green LED with a 220 ohm resistor (3.2 = 0.02 x R. R = 3.2 / 0.02, or
             R = 160 //  3.2 = 220 x I. I = 3.2 / 220, or I = 0.0145) The membrane keypad is a
             matrix of wires connected via push buttons and is represenred as such in the schematic.

            As our circuit needed to utalize two libraries, I decided to utalize the library we learned
            in class (servo motor) and an input device that required a library (as we needed both an
            input and output device). For the membrane keypad, I was able to find a well maintained
            library on github called "keypad" (by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig). It had all of
            the calls needed to set up and implement my keypad

          <h2>Circuit Operation:</h2>
          <div class="header">

          </div>
          <p>
            For my assignment 4, I knew I wanted to use the servo motor as we had spent so much time
            with it in class already and I thought that the membrade keypad was a very interesting
            element. When I considered the keypad, I thought about 4-digit pins. I wanted to make a
            machine that would take a pin and do something with the servo motor if correct. While
            creating the circuit, I used a red and green LED to debug (indicating write or wrong).
            After I added the feature of using the servo motor to raise a flag, I left the lights as
            part of the circuit as, without them, it's difficult to know when you get the pin wrong or
            when the cycle resets.

          <h4>
            Say you are using a servo motor you attach to pin 9. In your loop() you have the following code:

            seconds, for two seconds, and the y-axis the voltage at pin 9 with respect to ground.
